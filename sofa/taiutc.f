*
*  Time scale transformation:  International Atomic Time, TAI, to
*  Coordinated Universal Time, UTC.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  canonical.
*
*  Given:
*     TAI1,TAI2    d      TAI as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
*
*  Returned:
*     UTC1,UTC2    d      UTC as a 2-part quasi Julian Date (Notes 1-3)
*     J            i      status: +1 = dubious year (Note 4)
*                                  0 = OK
*                                 -1 = unacceptable date
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) TAI1+TAI2 is Julian Date, apportioned in any convenient way
*     between the two arguments, for example where TAI1 is the Julian
*     Day Number and TAI2 is the fraction of a day.  The returned UTC1
*     and UTC2 form an analogous pair, except that a special convention
*     is used, to deal with the problem of leap seconds - see the next
*     note.
*
*  2) JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap second unless
*     special measures are taken.  The convention in the present routine
*     is that the JD day represents UTC days whether the length is
*     86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds.  In the 1960-1972 era there were
*     smaller jumps (in either direction) each time the linear UTC(TAI)
*     expression was changed, and these "mini-leaps" are also included
*     in the SOFA convention.
*
*  3) The routine iau_D2DTF can be used to transform the UTC quasi-JD
*     into calendar date and clock time, including UTC leap second
*     handling.
*
*  4) The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
*     introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the future
*     to be trusted.  See iau_DAT for further details.
