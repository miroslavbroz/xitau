3-body perturbation as in the xi Tauri system.

Theory of Breiter & Vokrouhicky (2015) must be used,
becase all bodies are massive.

See also Nemravova et al. (2016).

Beware! Only 3, not 4, bodies must be used, otherwise,
the angular momentum is "skewed" by the 4th body and
the nodes do not circulate. :-(
