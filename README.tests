Tests in test_* directories were run during the development.

However, it is NOT guaranteed that all tests will run with
the current version of Xitau; I'm sorry! Sometimes, it is
necessary to adjust the input files, e.g., chi2.in, which has
a different format -- e.g., m1, m2, m3 vs. mtot, q1, q2;
or additional parameters -- e.g., spectral_slope, use_zero.
