This N-body code Xitau computes orbital evolution of multiple stars,
accounting for *mutual* gravitational interactions. It includes a chi^2
metric computation and a simplex algorithm. It was originally designed for
the solution of \xi Tauri problem (published in Nemravova et al. 2016).

Observational data (speckle-interferometry, RV's, minima timings aka TTV, ...)
have to be in suitable format, of course (see examples in DATA.tar.gz archive).

Warning:

Results of every numerical integration depend on discretisation of the problem.
In our case, it is controlled by dt (and dtout) parameters in param.in and param_BACK.in files.
It should be a small fraction (e.g. 1/20 to 1/100) of the SHORTEST orbital period (P_1).
The size of buffers used to store the results can be set up in simplex/simplex.inc.

As usually, one should check for convergence by decreasing dt -> ~0
or eps_BS parameter. However, if dtout is set too small, it may be rather memory
consuming (if not impossible). Luckily, the code always integrates to and outputs
all "times of interest", i.e. close to the times of all observations.

                                    *****
The primary time scale for Xitau is *TDB* (i.e., as in the JPL ephemerides).
                                    *****

UTC times of observations should be converted to TDB prior to computations;
otherwise, the time scales would be inconsistent!! In particular, the UTC
is discontinuous (cf. leap seconds) and we can hardly integrate the E.O.M.
and compare (discretized) continuous w. discontinuous...
