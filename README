This code xitau_chi2_simplex computes orbital evolution of multiple stars,
accounting for *mutual* gravitational interactions. It includes a chi^2
metric computation and simplex algorithm. It was designed for the solution
of \xi Tauri problem (to be published in Nemravova et al. 2016).

Observational data (speckle-interferometry, RV's, minima timings aka TTV, ...)
have to be in suitable format, of course (cf. DATA.tar.gz archive).

Warning:

Results of every numerical integration depend on discretisation of the problem.
In our case, it is controlled by dt (and dtout) parameters in param.in and param_BACK.in files.
It should be a small fraction (e.g. 1/20 to 1/100) of the SHORTEST orbital period (P_1).
The size of buffers used to store the results can be set up in simplex/simplex.inc.

As usually, one should check for convergence by decreasing dt -> ~0
or eps_BS parameter. For small dtout this may be rather memory consuming
(or even impossible) for very small P_1. In this unfortunate case, one should use
a different code version, which stores only interesting PARTS of the integration
(in the surroundings of observed times) -- see nyvir_chi2_simplex code.
